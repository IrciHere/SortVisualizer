# SortVisualizer

A simple program I made to practice my coding skills.

The application is made in C# .NET Framework 4.6.1, i allows you to visualize 5 sorting algorithms:
*Selection Sort
*Bubble Sort
*Quick Sort
*Merge Sort
*Insertion Sort

Visualization render is based on Canvas in WPF.

## How to use
* Write a number of objects you want to be sorted, between 10 and 100 (optimal number based on constant window size)
* Press the **GENERATE** button, randomized objects will appear
* Pick one of the sorting algorythms from the list, and sorting speed
* Press **START** button and watch the visualization
